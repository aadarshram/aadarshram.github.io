Hello, there! I am Aadarsh Ramachandran and I have no clue, why. Perhaps you could read further and let me know later?
Thank you.

### My story

I am currently a sophomore undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Madras in the Electrical Engineering department. I have a liking for automation in general but I am currently interested in exploring machine learning and robotics. Machine learning 'for' robotics, maybe. I started this site in the beginning of my sophomore year in hopes that I would explore deeper into this field and jot down my journey as I understand the concepts better. This also helps me keep a track of what I am doing or learning and if I am actually doing or learning something. You see, I often get lost quite easily. I also plan to write about interesting topics that may be outside this domain because it doesn't hurt to explore.

I love to work on interesting ideas and I love to work with people. If you are interested in working on something with me or just want to have a nice chat, feel free to reach out! I believe there will be some contact links in the footer.

See ya!
