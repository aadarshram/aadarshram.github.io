My name is Aadarsh Ramachandran and I don't have an answer to that yet. Perhaps you could read further and let me know later?
Thanks.

### My story

I am currently a sophomore undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Madras in the Electrical Engineering department. I seem to have a liking for automation in general but specifically machine learning and robotics. Machine learning 'for' robotics maybe. I wanted to start exploring deeper into this field and jot down my journey from small ideas to structured projects - everything!
Always on the lookout for fun opportunities!
